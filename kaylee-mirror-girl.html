    <h2>The Disappearance of Kaylee M. – The “Mirror Girl” of OSU</h2>
    <div class="meta">By Staff Writer | October 16, 2017</div>

    <p>On the night of October 14, 2017, Ohio State University student <strong>Kaylee M.</strong>, 21, left a house party on East 14th Avenue in Columbus a little after 2:00 a.m. Friends described her as “buzzed but cheerful,” carrying a half-finished drink and joking that she “needed to fix her eyeliner” before bed.</p>

    <p>Her roommate later told police she heard Kaylee in the bathroom, talking softly to herself and occasionally laughing. At first, it seemed like nothing unusual—until the sounds stopped abruptly.</p>

    <p>The bathroom door was unlocked. Inside, the light was still on, and a hairbrush lay on the floor. The mirror over the sink was unusually cold to the touch despite the apartment’s heating being on full blast. Kaylee was gone.</p>

    <p>According to the official missing person’s report, the last known activity on her phone was a Snapchat video sent to a friend at 2:37 a.m. The video showed only her reflection in the bathroom mirror. Halfway through, the reflection blinked out of sync with her—once, slowly—and smiled before the video cut to static.</p>

    <p>Kaylee’s body has never been found. To this day, students at OSU still whisper about the “Mirror Girl,” warning others not to linger too long in front of a bathroom mirror when intoxicated. Some believe she’s still there—waiting to trade places.</p>
