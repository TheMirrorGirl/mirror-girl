      <h2>The Disappearance of Kaylee M. – The “Mirror Girl” of OSU</h2>
      <div class="meta">By Staff Writer | October 16, 2017</div>

      <p>On the night of October 14, 2017, Ohio State University student <strong>Kaylee M.</strong>, aged 21, left a house party on East 14th Avenue in Columbus shortly after 2:00 a.m. Witnesses described her as “buzzed but cheerful,” holding a half-finished drink and joking she “needed to fix her eyeliner” before going to bed.</p>

      <p>Kaylee’s roommate later told police she heard Kaylee speaking softly to herself in the bathroom and laughing intermittently. At first, the sounds seemed harmless — until they stopped abruptly without explanation.</p>

      <p>The bathroom door was unlocked when checked. Inside, the light remained on, and a hairbrush was lying on the floor. The mirror above the sink was reported as unusually cold, despite the apartment’s heating system running full blast. Kaylee was nowhere to be found.</p>

      <p>According to official missing persons reports, the last activity on Kaylee’s phone was a Snapchat video sent at 2:37 a.m. to a friend. The video captured only her reflection in the bathroom mirror. Partway through, her reflection blinked out of sync — once, deliberately — and smiled before the footage abruptly cut to static.</p>

      <p>Kaylee’s body has never been recovered. Her disappearance has since sparked rumors among OSU students about the “Mirror Girl,” a ghostly figure said to haunt the campus. Students warn that if you’re intoxicated and stare into a mirror for too long, you may see Kaylee’s reflection smiling back — and risk swapping places.</p>
